# Test data

Two different test datasets are provided.
1. An EBSD scan of IN718 with an accompanying BSE image ("EBSD.ang" and "BSE.tif"). This dataset showcases a 2D example. Also included is a grain IDs file g enerated from OIM Analysis ("EBSD_grain.txt"). The two pts files, "control_pts.txt" and "distorted_pts.txt" are for this dataset. Note: the distorted resolution is 2.5 µm/px and the control resolution is 1.0 µm/px and the BSE/control image is rotated 180°.
2. A 3D EBSD scan of a CoNi superalloy and corresponding BSE images ("EBSD.dream3d", "BSE_images/*.tif").
